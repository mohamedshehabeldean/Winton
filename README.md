# Winton
Winton website acts as a link between the freelancer and the client and  facilitates communication between them,
Freelancing is a contract-based profession where you use your skills, 
education, and experience to work with many clients and take on different 
tasks. Freelancing usually includes jobs that allow you to work from home. 
It is just that many of the jobs performed by freelancers can be delivered 
online without being in the company's or client's place to increase income 
and avoid any disasters in the world such as the coronavirus that turned 
the world upside down.
Winton website acts as a link between the freelancer and the client and 
facilitates communication between them, and it is easy to use and helps the 
client to follow up on the previous work of the freelancer, and if he sees that 
he meets his needs, he begins to communicate with him, or the client 
writes a publication with all his needs and determines the time and the 
required price, and the freelancers begin to communicate with him.
One of the most important advantages of Winton instead of working for one 
full-time employer and getting a fixed salary in return, he has many clients 
according to his terms and price, because he believes that his work is 
worthy. 
Once the freelancer has determined the services they will provide, Winton 
allows them to share a collection of previous works, depending on their 
own skill, so that customers begin to communicate with him to implement 
their need and as the beauty of his work increases, more projects will come 
to him, for example, in terms of designing independent drawings, this may 
come in the form of images you have developed, and perhaps some pieces 
of art, as well as samples of previous works.
